# JS
 
- copyer.js: copy the wscript.exe to amsi.dll, not detected by Defender (12/23/2020)
- copyer-test.js: set AmsiEnable and run amsi.dll, (run amsi.dll) detected by Defender (12/23/2020) (AMSI for wscript, Bypassed by AmsiEnable) (behavior, shell stays after alert) 
- test9.js: generated by SharpShooter, detected by Defender (12/23/2020) (AMSI for function call eval)

## Note
- function call eval will trigger AMSI regardless of AmsiEnable. 
- run amsi.dll will trigger both AMSI and behavior analysis

- Working chain (12/23/2020): copy wscript.exe to amsi.dll, set AmsiEnable to 0, run asmi.dll with test9.js
- Possible Working chain: use another function than eval
