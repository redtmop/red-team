the more robust Language Modes 440 limit the functionality to avoid execution of code like our shellcode runner and operates at three distinct levels. The first (and default) level, FullLanguage, allows all cmdlets and the entire .NET framework as
well as C# code execution. By contrast, NoLanguage disallows all script text. RestrictedLanguage offers a compromise, allowing default cmdlets but heavily restricting much else.

To address this, Microsoft introduced the ConstrainedLanguage mode (CLM) with PowerShell version 3.0. When AppLocker (or WDAC) is enforcing whitelisting rules against PowerShell scripts, ConstrainedLanguage is enabled as well.

Check Language mode:

```
PS C:\Users\student> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode
ConstrainedLanguage

```

***Note:*** On Windows 7, 8.1 and earlier versions of Windows 10, PowerShell version 2 was installed by default along with the most recent version of PowerShell. On these systems, it may be possible to bypass constrained language mode by specifying version two of PowerShell ( -v2 ) when starting the process.
