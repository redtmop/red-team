When an RDP connection is created, the NTLM hashes will reside in memory for the duration of the session. The session does not terminate without a proper logout, which means simply disconnecting from the sessions will leave the hashes in memory. This creates an attack surface in which we can harvest the credentials if we compromise the machine.
